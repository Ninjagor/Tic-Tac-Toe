# Tic-Tac-Toe

## By Ninagor

This is my rendition of the popular game Tic-Tac-Toe. So far, this game only supports single player, and uses an AI built with JavaScript in order to playe moves.

## Changelog

#### (2/3/2023): First commit! The AI only does random moves with no intention of winning. However, the player can win, draw, or sometimes (unluckily) lose a game

#### (2/4/2023): Second commit, and a major commit! Multiple bug fixes. AI now analyzes every single move and plays the best one. If a player is one box away from winning, the AI will choose that box. Can think of and orchestrate plans up to winning in 2 moves. Also, a localstorage based score saving method was added.
